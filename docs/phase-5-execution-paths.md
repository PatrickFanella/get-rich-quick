# Phase 5: Execution Paths

> 30 issues across 7 tracks. **16 ready now** (6 already implemented), 14 blocked.
> Updated: 2026-03-27
> Tracking issue: [#348](https://github.com/PatrickFanella/get-rich-quick/issues/348)

## Context

Phase 4 delivered a complete backtesting engine (30 files, full test coverage). This phase bridges the working backend engine to production-readiness: close out Phase 4, land architecture improvements, build the API layer, and begin 60-day paper trading validation. Observability (#80, #83, #85) is deferred to server deployment.

**Implemented** = code exists in the repo but the issue has not been closed. These need verification against the issue acceptance criteria, then closure.

## Track A: Architecture Improvements

> Depends on: Nothing (fully independent)
> Source: Post-Phase 4 architecture review

**Status:** #342–#346 are implemented on `main` with passing tests. Need PRs and issue closure. #347 is a larger effort — can start anytime but not blocking.

## Track B: Phase 4 Completion

**Status:** #66, #68, #70, #73, #308 all exist in `internal/backtest/` (30 files with tests). Verify acceptance criteria and close. #315 (wire backtest to scheduler) is also implemented — close separately. #316 needs a real integration test. #317 blocked on API layer (#74).

## Track C: API Layer

> Depends on: Nothing for #74. #77 and #88 depend on #74.

| #   | Issue                                                             | Title                                               | Size | Blocker | Status  | Model           |

**Design reference:** `docs/design/api-design.md` specifies all endpoints (strategies, pipeline runs, portfolio, orders, trades, memory, risk controls, config) plus WebSocket event types. JWT + API key dual auth.

**Execution order:** #74 first (all endpoints + middleware skeleton), then #77 and #88 in parallel.

## Track D: CI/CD & Infrastructure

> Depends on: Nothing for #90. #91 depends on test suites existing. #94 depends on #91.

| 3   | [#94](https://github.com/PatrickFanella/get-rich-quick/issues/94) | Implement GitHub Actions CD pipeline for Docker image |  S   | #91     | BLOCKED | GPT-5.4 |

**Design reference:** `docs/design/infrastructure/deployment-and-operations.md` specifies multi-stage Alpine build, PostgreSQL service containers for CI, and Docker image publishing.

**Execution order:** #90 first (Dockerfile), #91 (CI with `go test -race -cover`), then #94 (CD publishes image on merge to main).

## Track E: Paper Trading

> Depends on: Track C #74 (API server). ADRs #93 and #96 should be decided first.

| #   | Issue                                                             | Title                                                     | Size | Blocker     | Status      | Model           |

**Status:** #82, #86, #87 are fully implemented in `internal/risk/` with tests (kill switch: API/file/env, circuit breaker: open/tripped/cooldown with auto-reset, position limits: per-position/total/concurrent/per-market). Verify and close.

#89 is **partial** — `TradingPlan` stores stop-loss/take-profit values and positions persist them, but the execution engine does not actively enforce SL/TP exits. Needs: automated exit logic in the order manager or a price-monitoring goroutine.

#79 is the capstone — requires API (#74) for strategy management and SL/TP enforcement (#89) for safety. The 60-day validation targets Sharpe > 1.0.

## Track F: Architecture Decisions

> Depends on: Nothing for decisions. Implementation depends on the chosen direction.

**Status:** ADRs #110 and #111 can be decided anytime. #112 (human review gate) and #113 (smoke test) need the API layer to exist.

## Key Design Principles

1. **Close before opening** — 13 issues are already implemented. Verify and close them before starting new work to keep the issue tracker honest.
2. **API is the critical path** — #74 (REST API) unblocks 5+ downstream issues including WebSocket, backtest comparison, smoke test, and paper trading validation. Start it in Wave 2.
3. **ADRs before implementation** — Position sizing (#93) and slippage assumptions (#96) must be decided before implementing SL/TP enforcement (#89), which in turn must be done before paper trading.
4. **SL/TP is the missing safety net** — Risk controls (kill switch, circuit breaker, position limits) are complete, but automated stop-loss/take-profit exits are stored-but-not-enforced. This is the main gap between "engine works" and "safe to paper trade."

## Model Recommendations

| Complexity | Model           | Use For                                                         |
| ---------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High       | Claude Opus 4.6 | REST API server (#74), WebSocket (#77), SL/TP enforcement (#89) |
| Medium     | GPT-5.4         | Docker (#90), CI/CD (#91, #94)                                  |
| Low        | GPT-5.4         | JWT auth (#88), comparison API (#317)                           |
| —          | Human           | All ADRs (#93, #96, #110, #111, #112)                           |
